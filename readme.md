## Memory Malestrom (Memstrom):

This project stores notes in a flat database file, and has a web interface to
interact with them, and display them.  Notes can be anything, and are typed with
category and tag markers that can be entered by the user.

The main idea of this app is to catalouge all relevent notes a user might have,
and display them in various ways in order for the user to organize their life,
or seek out new ideas.
