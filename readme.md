## Memory Malestrom (Memstrom):

This project stores notes in a flat database file, and has a web interface to
interact with them, and display them.  Notes can be anything, and are typed with
category and tag markers that can be entered by the user.

The main idea of this app is to catalouge all relevent notes a user might have,
and display them in various ways in order for the user to organize their life,
or seek out new ideas.

### Features:
- Edit and Delete a Note by Reference ID.
- Add a note:
    - Title
    - Note
    - Categories (comma separated)
    - Tags (comma separated)
    - id (generated by app, not user).
- Search and Filter for notes by:
    - text (in the body or title)
    - by categories
    - by tags.
- A single note can be found by typing in RefID and pressing "Edit"
- Note Randomizer:
    - Enter a number between 1 and 10.
    - Hit Randomize: Randomly selected notes appear.

- Filter bar works on Search and Randomizer. Does not work on Add/Edit/Delete note.
- Two separate sections exist: 
    - Add/Delete/Edit individual notes.
    - Search/Filter/Display sets of notes.

Fixing username mistakes (adding a line for test).
